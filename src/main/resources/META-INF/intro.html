    </p>


    <h3><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/bhuyanp">Support the project</a></h3>


    <h3>Features</h3>
    - Seamless integration with existing Spring Boot projects<br/>
    - Choose from light or dark theme to match your IDE's global theme<br/>
    - Let the plugin surprise you with a sensible and randomized theme "Surprise Me"<br/>
    - Customize the banner to your heart's content using Custom theme<br/>


    <h3>Usage Notes</h3>
    - Running the application from terminal will NOT reflect the banner changes as the plugin depends on IDE's internal
    build system<br/>
    - If you are using gradle, make sure to enable Build and run using IntelliJ under 'Settings->Build->Build Tools->Gradle'<br/>
    - If you choose to Build and run using Gradle instead of IntelliJ, then consider using the <a
            href="https://github.com/bhuyanp/spring-banner-gradle-plugin">Spring Banner Gradle Plugin</a> instead<br/>
